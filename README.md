## An HTML Canvas recreation of the arcade classic - a two player game.

#### The instructions are available on the page, but in a nutshell: 

1. When the page loads you will be presented with an empty canvas. Press h to start the game. Make sure you're ready before you do so!
2. The player on the left uses w to move up and s to move down. 
3. The player on the right uses the up and down arrows to do the same. 
4. Once a player has scored the game will freeze. Press g to start the next round. 
5. There is no maximum score - you can play as long as you like! 

Have fun!
